    <p class="def"><strong>String Concatenation</strong></p>
    <p>In many programming languages, string concatenation is a binary infix operator. The + (plus) operator is often overloaded to denote concatenation for string arguments: "Hello, " + "World" has the value "Hello, World".</p>

    <p class="def"><strong>Conditional Statment</strong></p>

    <p class="def"><strong>Comparative Operator</strong></p>
    <p>An operator that compares two operands based on a condition.</p>   

    <p class="def"><strong>Logical Operator</strong></p>
    <p>Logical operators check the "truthiness" or "falsiness" of two values.</p>

    <p class="def"><strong>Block-Level HTML Elements</strong></p>
    <p>Block level elements take up the entire width of their parent elements and begin on a new line.</p>

    <p class="def"><strong>Interpreter</strong></p>

    <p class="def"><strong>Debug</strong></p>
    <p>Generally you debug code to get rid of bugs (issues). Unless you're a perfect programmer, in which case good job. You use a <strong> debugger </strong> to run through your code and see where it "breaks", i.e. where the bug is.</p>    
    <p class="def"><strong>Concatenation</strong></p>
    <p>When you concatenate strings it means you're "bringing them together" into one string.</p>
