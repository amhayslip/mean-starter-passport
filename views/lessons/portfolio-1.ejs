    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>Let's put what we've learned to work. Throughout this week we'll work on building our own personal portfolio websites. At the end of the week, we'll launch it live for the world to see!. Follow the steps below to complete the first part of our project. Try not to cheat. If you need help, first refer back to today's lessons. If that doesn't work, ask someone around you. If that doesn't work, ask an instructor.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Creating our Project</h3>
    <p>The first thing we need is our project folder and files. Create a new folder and call it "personal-site" inside wherever you're storing your code. Inside of your "personal-site" folder, create two files: <strong>index.html</strong> and <strong>style.css</strong>. Do this all using the command-line.</p>
