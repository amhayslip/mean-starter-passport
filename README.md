# learn-app

A basic MEAN app for hosting the coding bootcamp curriculum.

### Running Locally
You will need to have `mongo` running and to use the `gulp` command in your terminal to launch the local server on `localhost:3000`.

### Dev Process
When developing or adding new curriculum items, please checkout a new branch and commit often. When you're ready to merge it in, please do a Pull Request github and allow adequate time for all parties to make comments before merging it in. Always assume that Master is in production.
